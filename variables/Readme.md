# Variable

```
A variable is a name of container in programming which is used to store data that can be reuse in future and can be changed later. it is a placeholder of value like number , string , or object.

Eg..

let name = "Samir"; // "name" is the variable holding the value "Samir"
console.log(name);  // Output: Samir
```

# Key Concepts of Variables

1.  Declaration

    - this is a procees of creating of variables in javaScript
    - we use kewords like `let`, `Var` or `const` to declare variables.
    - A variable Can be declared without value, but it will initially hold the value `undefined`.

2.  Initialization

    - At the time of declaration: You assign a value right when you create the variable.

    ```
    let age = 20; // Initialization happens here (value 20 is assigned to 'age')
    console.log(age); // Output: 20
    ```

    - Later in the program: You declare the variable first and assign a value to it later.

            ```
            let age; // Variable is declared but not initialized yet
            age = 20; // Initialization happens here (value 20 is assigned to 'age')
            console.log(age); // Output: 20
            ```
