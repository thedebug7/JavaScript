# dynamically typed language

A dynamically typed language determines variable types at runtime instead of compile time. You don't need to declare variable types explicitly, and they can change based on the assigned value. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

Pros: Flexible and faster for development.

Cons: Type errors are only caught during execution, making debugging harder.
